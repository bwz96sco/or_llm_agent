The selling price is 240 dollars per unit. \n At the beginning of January, the factory has 80 skilled workers, each working 160 hours per month. To meet production needs, the factory can recruit and train new workers. Training a new worker takes 50 hours of a skilled worker’s time for instruction, and the training period lasts one month, after which the trainee can become a skilled worker. Skilled workers are paid 2,000 dollars per month. Trainees receive a living allowance of 800 dollars during the training month. After completing training, new workers receive the same salary and work efficiency as skilled workers. Each month, 2\\% of skilled workers (including those newly trained and on the job for at least one month) leave due to various reasons. \n The factory starts the year with 400 units of inventory and requires that the ending inventory in June not exceed 100 units.

A head nurse is in charge of creating the duty schedule. The scheduling plan must be personnel- or cost-efficient, while also being reasonable and practical. The following is a plan under consideration: Plan 1: Each nurse works 5 consecutive days, followed by 2 days off, and works a different shift each day, cycling through Shift 1 to Shift 5 in sequence. For example:,If a nurse starts on Monday, she works:Shift 1 on Monday,Shift 2 on Tuesday,…,Shift 5 on Friday; Another nurse starting on Wednesday would work: Shift 1 on Wednesday,…,Shift 5 on Sunday.
